Tutorial for the NGS summer course at BiRC (Aarhus University).

Find the notebook inside the `Notebook` folder. Package installation in the notebook is written for usage on Google Colab, so upload and run the notebook there :)

Start github issues if bugs show up or you have questions and suggestions.
